 ## Core Principles
- Write concise, technical code following SOLID principles

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards with PHP 8.1+ features
- Use strict typing: declare(strict_types=1)
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use Service Classes for business logic with slim controllers

## Code Architecture

### Directory Structure
- Follow Laravel's official directory structure
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories
- Organize routes into feature-specific files

### Naming Conventions
- Models: Singular, PascalCase (User.php)
- Controllers: Plural, PascalCase (UsersController.php)
- Methods: camelCase
- Database Columns: snake_case
- Files: Match class names exactly

### Class Design
- Controllers:
  - Must be final classes or anything best practices
  - Read-only (no property mutations)
  - Slim controllers with dependency injection via methods
  - Use Form Requests for validation

- Models:
  - Must be final classes
  - Utilize Eloquent relationships
  - Define proper database indexes
  - Implement robust data validation

### Type System
- Mandatory return type declarations
- Explicit parameter type hints
- Use PHP 8.1+ features (union types, nullable types)
- Maintain strict type consistency throughout

## Database & ORM
- Use Eloquent ORM over raw SQL
- Implement Repository pattern
- Use migrations and seeders
- Implement proper indexing
- Use database transactions for data integrity
- Utilize Laravel's query builder for complex queries

## API Development
- Implement versioning
- Use API Resources for response transformation
- Follow REST principles
- Use Laravel Sanctum for authentication
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use Laravel's built-in pagination

Note: read files and apply code and response code with best way and follow existing code prectises with better way
modules\CMS\Contracts\Field.php
modules\CMS\Support\Html\Field.php
modules\CMS\Support\Html\Traits\InputField.php
modules\CMS\Support\Html\RepeaterField.php
modules\CMS\Support\Html\RepeaterItem.php
modules\Backend\resources\views\components\form_checkbox_json.blade.php
modules\Backend\resources\views\components\form_repeater_item.blade.php
modules\Backend\resources\views\components\form_repeater.blade.php
i give you the complete code based how our filed management works and this fields work both blade and JSON files also please read all files before response.
page block management
modules\Backend\resources\views\backend\page-block\block.blade.php
modules\CMS\Abstracts\PageBlock.php

our testimonial blocks with repeater field type the problem is hear themes\edufax\data\blocks\testimonial_area.json . and others places also. and aslo same repeater field in blade temple others places like plugins\event-management\src\resources\views\backend\event\components\event-info.blade.php
{ Field::repeater(
in blade template, this repeater works without any problem and error, but problems come in json files it show some error. this repeater and others many filed not workes in json bage blocks. when we add new blocks instantly not work, but when we save or update this page and come this blocks again this repeater workes why this happend please carefully findout the exact problem
and show this error in json file The page blocks page

Note: read all files folders and complete the system and carefully make changes and make sure do not remove mejor things and do not distory current system why not this cms works many places and production aslo i do not need any breaking changes and breack this system. carefully handle and complete this system with more robust scalable and parfect way and using current system coding prectises. and explain everything.
Note: do not create any seperet js file add js or css in Internal css. and do not distrube core cms any files why not this system workes others files.
and aslo "type": "select", also not worked many time one time it workes others time not workes. why its happend i do not no. already i say your some response some times work in create time, some times not work edit time and some times work in edit time some time not work in create time any many more issue carefully handle and also javascript carefully apply id and class also do not remove or distroy. and yout target just json problem not distrube blade i think this is javascript confilct or others problem. without mejor changes first just fix those problem.

Note: and aslo some got error when we add new block in blage block i think this issue should fixed latter
